# Intro

This Machine Learning Notes are consisted of mainly two parts: 

1. Implement of some classical machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Perceptron, SVM, etc.
2. Implement of basic deep learning methods like RNN, LSTM, self-attention and Graph Neural Networks.

Note: Most of the implement is based on PyTorch and NumPy.
